<h2> BIO </h2>

<p> 

My name is Aubrey Senzani, I was born in Malawi but lived most my life in different countries within southern Africa.

I'm ambitious, driven, passionate, get along well with others, always willing to learn and develop myself in all aspects of life.

To date, my proudest achievement has been developing software engineering skills. An industry to which I had no prior academic or practical knowledge on and I hope to further upskill my programming capabilities and knowledge on python.
